# Idex

Idex is a lightweight diagram studio built with React and Vite. It provides a fast local development experience for exploring the UI and iterating on diagram workflows.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended for Vite 5)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`). Open it in your browser to use the app.

### Production build & preview (optional)

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The preview server will report the local URL to verify the production build.
